# Graduation-Project
In this project, it is aimed to create a tool in the QT environment. It converts C
code into algorithmic state machine and also displays the resulting ASM and converts
this ASM to Verilog code. The tool also provides an environment where the user can
create his own state diagram. In addition, there is an environment where you can create
a state diagram from scratch, and the diagram you create can be converted to verilog
code without c code. The state diagram is designed to be zoomable and editable. The
tool aims to get the closest results to a hand drawn Asm and executable verilog code.
The focus of the project is the world of embedded and real-time systems. Verilog
and state machine are indispensable parts of this world. However, manually designed
state diagrams require a long process. The project plans to eliminate these difficulties.
Projects designed simply in C will be instantly transformed into state diagram and
verilog code. Thanks to this project, it will make the use of Asm and Verilog more
effective in the world of embedded and real-time systems.
